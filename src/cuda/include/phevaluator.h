/*
 * Return an integer indicating the rank of the hand. The strongest hand
 * returns 1, and the weakest hand returns 7462.
 *
 * Each parameter is a card ID, ranged [0 to 52).
 *
 * The two least significant bits represent the 4 suits, ranged from 0-3.
 *
 * The rest of it represent the 13 ranks, ranged from 0-12.
 *
 * More specifically:
 * deuce = 0, trey = 1, four = 2, five = 3, six = 4, seven = 5, eight = 6,
 * nine = 7, ten = 8, jack = 9, queen = 10, king = 11, ace = 12.
 *
 * So that you can use `rank * 4 + suit` to get the card ID.
 *
 * The complete card Id mapping can be found below. The rows are the ranks
 * from 2 to Ace, and the columns are the suits: club, diamond, heart and
 * spade.
